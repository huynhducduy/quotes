# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ♥️

Ensure your pull request adheres to following guidelines:

- Search included quotes before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Only add quotes you think are great! Feel welcome to remove entries that you think aren't great!
- Use the following format: `> "Quote" - Author`
- If you can't find the author of the quote, you can skip adding the author.
- The quote should be put into its appropriate category. Pick one you think is closest if you are not sure.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- You can also add related links and repositories in the end.

We welcome all [your suggestions](../../edit/master/README.md)!
